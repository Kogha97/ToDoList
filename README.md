Achieved so far for basic functionality:
- how to add an item from input to list (all)
- delete button (J&T)
- send item to right list (R)
- calendar display (T)
- mark item as done
 
Goals until next meet (Tuesday 17.10):
- catch up on each other's functionality skills
- edit button/functionality
- nuance functionality with storage knowledge (will only learn on Monday in class)
